# HR Analytics Dashboard | Power BI

Introduction:
Attrition is an important metric many organizations worldwide closely monitor. It's a good way to measure health of the it's workforce and identify any potential areas for improvement. I found an open dataset on HR analytics data on kaggle for this analysis. Dataset can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshika2301/hr-analytics-dataset/data

## Process
I decided to dig through the data to find out any patterns or trends in the given data that might answer the reason why employees were leaving the company.

Attrition Rate is the ratio of employees who left during a period to the total employees, if there are no new hires. It's usually shown as percentage. And I used this metric to find any correlation in the dataset categories. Does increasing distance from home make them likely to leave the company? What about people who works overtime? These were the sort of question which I'm going to explore. And I made a dashboard that gives you an overall picture of all the factors that affected employee attrition.


## Key Findings
