# HR Analytics Dashboard | Power BI

Introduction:
Goal of this analysis was to identify patterns and trends that contribute to employee attrition within the company. Using key metrics such as attrition rate, I explored various factors to understand why employees were leaving. Attrition is an important metric many organizations worldwide closely monitor. It's a good way to measure the health of the workforce and identify any potential areas for improvement. I found an open dataset on HR analytics data on Kaggle for this analysis. This dataset contains various employee attributes such as gender, age, job role, attrition?, overtime? , salary etc... Dataset can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshika2301/hr-analytics-dataset/data

## Process
To uncover the reasons behind the attrition, I calculated the attrition rate. Which is the ratio of employees who left during a period to the total employees, if there are no new hires. The overall attrition rate was used to find correlations across various categories in the dataset, such as job roles, salary, overtime work, and demographics. Questions like "Does overtime increase the likelihood of leaving?" and "Are younger employees more likely to leave?" guided the exploration. An interactive dashboard was also created to visualize the factors affecting attrition.


## Key Findings

- Out of 1,470 employees, 237 left the company, resulting in an overall attrition rate of approximately 16.1%
- Employees who worked overtime had a significantly higher attrition rate (30.5%) compared to those who did not (10.4%), indicating that working overtime makes employees three times more likely to leave. 
- Sales representatives left the most(40% attrition rate) compared to other job roles. In addition to this female HR representatives were also leaving in higher numbers.
- Employees are more likely to leave during their first two years in the company. This might indicate the company's lack of a growth path or lower base pay
- Employees who received an annual salary of less than 50k $ were 2.25X more likely to leave the company. 
- Single people were more likely to leave the company. Might indicates lack of social connections or career outlook
- Most people who were leaving the company were young adults in the age group 18-25. There were 2X more likely to leave
- Employee who felt their job involvement or job level to be lowest also more likely to leave

## Recommendations

- Reduce Overtime Pressure: Monitor and reduce overtime by increasing the staff or distributing the workload. Also, try rewarding overtime with incentives
- Address High Sales and Female HR Attrition: Review sales quotas, compensation, and career growth for sales representative roles. 
- Address Female HR Attrition: Review workplace culture, and gender inequalities and conduct exit interviews
- New employees Retention: Set clear growth paths for new employees. Ensure competitive salary packages
- Engaging Young Employees: Increase socializing and team-building activities for young and single employees. And conduct regular employee engagement surveys
